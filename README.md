# Full-Stack Python Vue.js and Flask Tutorial Project

This repository contains a full-stack application developed as a tutorial project. The project showcases the following technologies and practices:

- Front End: Built with Vue.js, using Bootstrap and BootstrapVue for styling.
- Back End: Implemented with Flask, providing a RESTful API for the front-end connection.
- API Interaction: Utilized Axios for making HTTP requests between the front end and back end.

This project demonstrates how to integrate Vue.js and Flask, creating a seamless connection between the client-side and server-side of a web application.
